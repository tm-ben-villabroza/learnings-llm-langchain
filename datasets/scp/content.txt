SCP-682, also known as "The Hard-to-Destroy Reptile," is a highly dangerous and resilient creature classified as a Keter-class anomaly. It appears to be a massive reptilian creature with a heavily armored hide, sharp claws, and powerful jaws. SCP-682 possesses an incredible regenerative ability, allowing it to recover from almost any injury, including complete dismemberment. It has displayed extreme aggression towards all life forms and has proven to be highly intelligent, showing signs of problem-solving skills and adaptability.

SCP-682 is contained within a specially designed containment chamber, which is constantly monitored and reinforced to prevent its escape. Various methods have been attempted to neutralize or terminate SCP-682, including exposure to extreme temperatures, acid, and even nuclear weapons, but none have been successful. The creature has shown a remarkable ability to adapt and evolve, quickly developing resistance to any attempts made against it. Due to its extreme danger and the difficulty of containment, SCP-682 is considered one of the most challenging anomalies to manage.

SCP-096, also known as "The Shy Guy," is a humanoid creature classified as Euclid-class. It is approximately 2.38 meters tall and possesses a thin, bony body. SCP-096's most notable feature is its face, which is completely devoid of any facial features except for a mouth. When a person views SCP-096's face, either directly or through a recording, it will enter a state of extreme distress and begin a violent pursuit of the person who viewed it. SCP-096 has shown an incredible ability to track down its targets, regardless of distance or obstacles, and has been observed to reach them within minutes.

To contain SCP-096, its containment chamber is equipped with a large steel plate that can be raised to block any line of sight to the creature's face. In the event of a breach, personnel are instructed to avoid looking at SCP-096's face and to immediately cover their faces to prevent accidental viewing. If someone does view SCP-096's face, a termination order is issued to eliminate all witnesses to prevent further incidents.

SCP-076, also known as "Able," is a humanoid entity classified as Euclid-class. It appears as a well-built, heavily muscled male in his late twenties, with black hair and green eyes. SCP-076 is capable of rapid cellular regeneration, making it nearly indestructible. It possesses immense strength and combat skills, being proficient in various forms of armed and unarmed combat. SCP-076 has shown a strong desire for combat and will actively seek out opponents to engage in battle.

SCP-076 is contained within a specially constructed containment chamber, which includes various security measures to prevent its escape. It is equipped with a collar that can be remotely detonated to neutralize SCP-076 in case of a breach. Personnel assigned to SCP-076's containment are required to undergo rigorous combat training and be prepared to engage in combat with the entity if necessary.

It is important to note that all three SCPs mentioned, SCP-682, SCP-096, and SCP-076, are highly dangerous and require strict containment protocols due to their aggressive and potentially lethal nature.
